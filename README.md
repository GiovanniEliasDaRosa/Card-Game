## Installation

1. Check if you have some kind of local server and if you have PHP.
   > I created the project using **XAMPP**, I recommend it too.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the project folder and execute the file `RunServer.bat` and keep the command prompt onpen to keep the Web Socket server online
   > If you want, you can open the project folder and navigate through to the `api` folder and execute the `server.php` with the command prompt, pasting the following code:

```shell
cd api
php server.php
```

**Certify to NOT USE `php api/server.php`, BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT WORK**
